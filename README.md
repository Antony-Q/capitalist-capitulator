## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). This application uses a command-line application, made from scratch, to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
  
## Deployment  
Download the application folder. Use Terminal to navigate to the project directory and type the following: `npm start`. May require `npm install` first, if an error occurs.
